<h1>A Mythology of Great Britain</h1>
<h3>Chapter I</h3>
<p>	I stood in a large forest. It was familiar as my own hand, yet I knew that I had not been there before. I recognized every thing, but nothing I remembered nothing. Brown leaves fell from dying trees into a thick mist. The mist kept me from seeing more than ten feet in front of myself. As my eyes were of little use a began to use my ears. I listened, hearing little at first: a twig snapping; wings flapping. As I listened longer, I heard a gentle rumble. The rumble grew louder until I recognized the beats of horses’ hooves. Suddenly, I saw one of the horses. On the horse sat a rider dressed in a long, blue robe. He sat erect with his right hand on his reigns. In his left hand he held a long and narrow trumpet, and on his head, the man had a golden crown. His face was pale and there was something strange about his appearance. I could see him, and yet I could see right through him. He was a ghost, like those who followed him. Behind the man was a taller, younger man dressed in Lincoln green. His tunic was shorter that the first man’s, only coming to his knees. He seemed to be the leader of the thirty men who came behind him. Each man was dressed like their leader, wearing Lincoln green.</p>
<p>One by one each of the thirty-two horses and riders walked around me, forming a circle, and dismounted all at once. As soon as a man’s last foot touched the ground his horse would disappear into the fog which lied on the forest floor. The dismounted men looked at me for quite some time. Eventually, I said to the man in blue, “Who art thou, and these men with thee?” He looked to each of the men around him and said, “I was king John of England. These men were Robin Hood and his band of merry men.” He must have sensed my confusion for he said, “In life Robin Hood was the enemy of my power. I have no power now, and so he is no longer my enemy. Now, hear the message which I have been sent to give thee: Thy kingdom is in great peril. Many wish to overthrow it. Do not make the mistakes I did. I allowed others to take the power that was rightly mine. I was a coward and a fool. There is a man whom thou must not allow to stay alive. Thou must sign his death warrant today. Thou knowest his name. It is the same as mine. His name is John.” After hearing these words my eyes grew heavy, and a began to fall to the ground. As I was falling King John yelled into my face, “Thou must take from the bird a pen.” With those words, I fell into a deep sleep. </p>
<p>While I slept I had a dream. At first I saw nothing. All seemed to be both black, and white, and red, and green, and every other color imaginable all at once. As I tuned around I saw a large ostrich. It had two necks and two heads. On each head was the face of a man. The right face grinned so broadly that I thought the grin might tear the face in half. The left face had a frown as dramatic the other.</p>
<p>I took a step toward the ostrich. The enthusiastic voice of the grinning face startled as it said, “The pen is mightier than the sword…” The frowning face interrupted the grinning face and said, “He that lives by the pen, dies by the pen.” Each step I took the two faces repeated these words. Finally I reached the ostrich, and remembering the words of King John, drew the beast pen feather I could see. As soon as I drew the feather, my eyes opened, and I awoke from my dreams. Ι watched as the feather I had plucked from the ostrich floated from the ceiling, landing on the end of my bed. I sat up and picked the feather up and inspected it. The feather had been carved into a pen, it was rather large and coarse for a pen, and on it were written the words, “By this pen shall an evil man fall, and a kingdom be established.” I thought about the things I had dreamed, and the more I thought, the more I was sure of what I needed to do.</p>
